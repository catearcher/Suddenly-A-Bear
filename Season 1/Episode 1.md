### Scene 2: "Better Late Than Fever"

*A man is late to work. He does not like this one bit. This man prefers to be on time. Mephisto materializes before him.*

Mephisto: I can help you with that, mortal!  
Man: How?  
Mephisto: I can make it so you are on time.  
Man: Where's the catch?  
Mephisto: You will have a fever.  
Man: I refuse.
