### Scene 1: "Suddenly a Bear"

*A man is mowing his lawn. Another man in a dog costume approaches him.*

Dog: Sir. Sir? Do you have a direction for me? I am looking for the bank.  
Man: Turn left at the post office.  
Dog: Thank you. You will not regret this.

*Exit the dog. The man continues mowing the lawn. The lawnmower has turned into a bear, but the man does not seem to mind.*

Dog: ... or will you?


### Scene 2: "Better Late Than Fever"

*A man is late to work. He does not like this one bit. This man prefers to be on time. Mephisto materializes before him.*

Mephisto: I can help you with that, mortal!  
Man: How?  
Mephisto: I can make it so you are on time.  
Man: Where's the catch?  
Mephisto: You will have a fever.  
Man: I refuse.  

*The man would rather be late than fever. He is then suddenly attacked by a bear.*
